# PoliTo Explainable AI - Project

## Getting Started
- look for lime(and multimodel database) related implementations => we can use the long paper's database and the base
	- compare lime and mm-shap using the code and database => take notes on the implementation and work-flow differences
- read and analyze paper focusing on lime implementation on multimodel cases
## Implementation & Testing
- considering the implementation specific notes => start implementing mm-lime
